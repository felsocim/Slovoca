<h1>What is Slovoca?</h1>
<p>Slovoca is a simple but powerful portable (can be launched for example from a 
USB flash drive) software tool designed for anyone who is  
learning one or more foreign languages. It allows you to create and maintain  
your own customized vocabulary of all new foreign words and expressions you have  
learned. Each of them can be supplied with its phonetic transcription, one or  
more translations and your personal annotations. This way you can easily get  
back to anything you have already learned and refresh your memory by recalling  
desired vocabulary entry's translations together with all the notes, annotations  
and phonetic transcription you provided the entry with.</p> 
<h2>Scalability and portability</h2>
<p>Slovoca enables you to create as many customized vocabularies as you wish. Each vocabulary you create with Slovoca can be stored in one single project file   
that you can take with you anywhere, for example on a USB flash drive. Then, you   
can easily update it using Slovoca on any other computer   
that meets the Slovoca's hardware and software requirements (see sections below).</p>
<h2>Supported languages</h2>
<p>Each vocabulary is defined by two languages: your native language and the  
foreign language you are learning the words and expressions of. When you create  
a new vocabulary project in Slovoca, you have to define these two languages by  
selecting them from the provided list of supported languages. This list may vary  
from one computer to another depending on the languages and cultures supported  
by the version of Microsoft(R) .NET Framework you are using. </p>

<h2>Hardware and software requirements</h2>
